			<p> Have you ever wondered how fast that you type? Good news! I created a typing test that you can use. Type the text below in the field exactly as it is written and see how long it took to type it. Try as many times as you like. <strong>GOOD LUCK! </strong> </p>

			<p><em>Note:</em> The timer will not stop until what you typed matched the text provided for the test.</p>
